# 5staropensource
Vergelijkbaar met 5 star open data, maar dan voor open source

- make your code available on the Web under an open license
- make it available from the start as a versioned code repository (e.g. Github)
- accept issues (open development)
- accept pull requests (open collaboration)
- make it available as a one-click installable
- make it available as a runnable container
- make it available "as a service"
